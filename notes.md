# Bughouse Chess Notes
Elastic IP address replaces public IP address in Amazon Web Services

Learned we need sharp sign for title

Learned that a href thing needs https in it

I have to have the index file in public instead of inside a directory in public

Flex thing has to have in html tag the height declared

I need accordion elements

We need, in a fetch, "response" and "jsonResponse" variables

We have to run npm; it won't work otherwise
