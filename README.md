>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

### Elevator pitch

I'm doing a game called Nim about taking piles of marbles from a pile of marbles that starts with a certain number of marbles, which they can choose. Each game will have two players take turns with each other and take out a certain number of marbles, from 1 up to a number of their choice. Whoever takes the last marble wins.

### Key features

- Some of the features will be pages that allow people to see what games are available to be joined and join games as observers.
- People will be able to see the list of games and people will be able to make new games.
- The number of marbles will be displayed in a box during the game, rather than showing actual marbles.
- People can start games and other people can join.

- **Service** - This will be used to write computer functions that can calculate new numbers of marbles, and hash passwords.
- **DB/Login** - This is for making usernames, which can go in the databases, and for checking passwords
